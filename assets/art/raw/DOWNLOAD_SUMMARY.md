## Usage Notes

1. **Check metadata files** - Each major download has a `.metadata.json` with source URL, license, and style hints
2. **NES Compatibility** - Look for 8x8 or 16x16 assets with limited colors
3. **Attribution** - CC-BY assets require crediting the author
4. **Reduction potential** - Many 32x32 assets could be reduced to 16x16 for NES use

## Archive Files

All `.zip` files are preserved alongside their extracted directories for reference.

## Style Hints Available

Metadata files include style hints like:
- `nes-compatible`, `nes-style`
- `gameboy`, `4-color`
- `8x8`, `16x16`, `32x32`

## Next Steps

The asset loader agent can:

2. Identify NES-compatible assets by size and style hints
3. Process images for palette reduction
4. Extract individual sprites from sprite sheets
5. Generate game-specific asset manifests
